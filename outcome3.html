      <h2>Reader's Response: Analyzing Primary Data</h2>

        <!-- Your reflection text for research proposal goes here -->
        This reader's response helped me learn how to critically gather, organize, and interpret qualitative data in a systematic and ethical way. Through learning and applying coding techniques, I became more confident in analyzing firsthand information rather than relying solely on secondary sources. It also pushed me to think carefully about how data is handled—from anonymization for ethical protection to avoiding cherry-picking and presenting balanced interpretations. By engaging directly with the research process and following steps laid out by scholars like Denny and Clark, I developed stronger skills in evaluating sources, drawing evidence-based conclusions, and being transparent about methodology. These are all key parts of becoming an informed and responsible researcher.

        Scrolling through endless chatbot convos and Reddit threads didn’t just make me a temporary AI therapist—it taught me how to read the internet like a researcher. Analyzing firsthand testimonials and coding emotional responses into themes wasn’t just about tracking data; it was about critically evaluating sources, identifying patterns, and understanding the biases and contexts within online spaces. I had to think carefully about what counted as credible evidence, what emotional cues could be misinterpreted, and how not to let personal assumptions guide the results. Instead of just consuming information, I had to filter, question, and organize it meaningfully—which is what information literacy is all about. The process turned chaotic user stories into focused insights and helped me balance empathy with analysis, especially when handling sensitive emotional data.
