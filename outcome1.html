      <h2>Research Proposal</h2>
      <p class="reflection-text">
        <!-- Your reflection text for research proposal goes here -->
        This research proposal served as my initial step into forming questions about the use of AI in very human circumstances, such as the capability of AI being a person's friend. Writing this research proposal deepened my understanding of genuine inquiry by pushing me to go beyond surface-level curiosity and dive into a meaningful, nuanced question about the role of AI in human relationships. It wasn’t just about finding answers—I had to critically examine why this topic matters, who it affects, and how to explore it in a way that respects complexity. Crafting the methodology, especially the ethnographic approach, helped me realize how important it is to engage with real human experiences and perspectives rather than relying solely on assumptions or abstract theories. This process made me more intentional and reflective about what it means to ask a research question that actually matters—to me and to the broader world.

      <h2>Project 1 First Draft ("The Shitty Draft")</h2>
      <p class="reflection-text">
        <!-- Your reflection text for final paper goes here -->
        Writing this first draft helped me engage in genuine inquiry by pushing me to move beyond surface-level curiosity and explore the emotional and ethical dimensions of AI companionship through real-world examples. By diving into user testimonials, analyzing online interactions, and engaging with scholarly research, I began to understand the complexities behind why people form bonds with AI and where those bonds fall short. This process encouraged me to ask more critical questions, challenge my own assumptions, and remain open to unexpected insights—shifting from simply researching a topic to genuinely investigating how AI is shaping human connection in nuanced, sometimes contradictory ways.
