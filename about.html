                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>As I create this portfolio, I am a sophomore at the University of Central Florida studying finance with a minor in legal studies. As an aspiring lawyer, writing is an important part of the development of my career. Throughout this course, I have learned about and reflected on many aspects of my writing that I hope will only improve as I continue my undergraduate career.</p>
                <p>I know that my writing is not nearly as proficient as I wish for it to be for my career, so I will continue to write and improve my skills through practice and reflection. I anticipate graduating in May 2027, and I am committed to leveraging my education and experiences to make meaningful contributions in the fields of finance and law.</p>
