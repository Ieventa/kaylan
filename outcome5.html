        Digging into the emotional complexities of AI companionship in my final project helped me realize that contributing knowledge isn’t just about saying something new—it’s about adding meaningfully to an ongoing conversation. By analyzing real user experiences and coding qualitative data from platforms like Reddit and app reviews, I was able to uncover emotional patterns that don’t always show up in mainstream AI discussions. Instead of just repeating what scholars like Pan & Mou or Liu-Thompkins said, I connected their work to firsthand data and expanded on it with my own insights about authenticity, dependence, and digital intimacy. This assignment showed me that my voice has a place in academic discourse when it’s backed by thoughtful research, ethical analysis, and a genuine attempt to understand human behavior in the digital age.

        This assignment really pushed me to go beyond just absorbing information and actually contributing to the conversation about AI empathy. By diving deep into the ethical implications and exploring how AI affects human emotions, I wasn’t just ticking off boxes—I was actively shaping my understanding and weaving together different scholarly perspectives. Each source I annotated helped me refine my thoughts on the topic, especially when I had to make connections between complex ideas and real-world scenarios. The feedback from peers gave me the chance to tighten up my analysis, making me feel like I was not just learning from others but adding my voice to the dialogue. It wasn’t just about learning—it was about contributing fresh insights into an evolving field.
