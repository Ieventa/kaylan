        This research proposal served as my initial step into forming questions about the use of AI in very human circumstances, such as the capability of AI being a person's friend. Writing this research proposal deepened my understanding of genuine inquiry by pushing me to go beyond surface-level curiosity and dive into a meaningful, nuanced question about the role of AI in human relationships. It wasn’t just about finding answers—I had to critically examine why this topic matters, who it affects, and how to explore it in a way that respects complexity. Crafting the methodology, especially the ethnographic approach, helped me realize how important it is to engage with real human experiences and perspectives rather than relying solely on assumptions or abstract theories. This process made me more intentional and reflective about what it means to ask a research question that actually matters—to me and to the broader world.
