                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>As I create this portfolio, I am a freshman at the University of Central Florida majoring in data science. As someone passionate about data and analytics, writing is an important part of communicating complex ideas effectively—especially in interdisciplinary fields like tech. Throughout this course, I have learned about and reflected on many aspects of my writing that I hope will continue to grow as I move through my undergraduate career.
                <p>I recognize that my writing isn’t yet where I want it to be, especially for the roles I hope to pursue in the future. But through consistent practice and self-reflection, I’m committed to improving. I anticipate graduating in May 2028, and I aim to use both my technical skills and communication strengths to make meaningful contributions in the field of data science.</p>
