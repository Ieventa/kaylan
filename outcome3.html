        <!-- Your reflection text for research proposal goes here -->
        This reader's response helped me learn how to critically gather, organize, and interpret qualitative data in a systematic and ethical way. Through learning and applying coding techniques, I became more confident in analyzing firsthand information rather than relying solely on secondary sources. It also pushed me to think carefully about how data is handled—from anonymization for ethical protection to avoiding cherry-picking and presenting balanced interpretations. By engaging directly with the research process and following steps laid out by scholars like Denny and Clark, I developed stronger skills in evaluating sources, drawing evidence-based conclusions, and being transparent about methodology. These are all key parts of becoming an informed and responsible researcher.

        This particular reader's response encouraged me to engage with both analytical and creative approaches to literacy. The process of defining and reflecting on the concept of "literary sponsorship" pushed me to blend critical thinking with personal experience, allowing me to express complex ideas through a mix of academic and personal writing. I explored how AI and digital tools serve as modern literacy sponsors, using a formal, academic tone to analyze their influence, while also drawing on my own experiences to connect theory with practice. By navigating between different genres and tones, I gained a deeper understanding of how writing can shift based on purpose and audience, helping me build versatility in how I communicate ideas.
