      <h2>Reader's Response: Understanding Genre</h2>

        <!-- Your reflection text for research proposal goes here -->
        Walking through this readers response felt like decoding the secret handshake of a discourse community. By digging into how genres like research papers function within fields like data science, I learned that genre isn’t just about format—it’s about fulfilling a community’s expectations and values through structured communication. Analyzing the moves of a typical research paper helped me understand how knowledge is legitimated, shared, and even challenged within academic spaces. It also taught me how genres shape participation: they tell you what kind of language to use, what structure to follow, and what counts as valid contribution. This awareness sharpened my ability to not just recognize genres, but actually produce work that aligns with specific rhetorical goals and community standards—core to what “research genre production” is all about.

      <h2>Project 2 Proposal</h2>
      <p class="reflection-text">
        <!-- Your reflection text for final paper goes here -->
        Starting over from scratch for Project 2 was not exactly what I had in mind, but weirdly, it ended up being the ultimate crash course in "research genre production." Working on this proposal pushed me to think way more critically about how each genre functions—not just in theory, but in practice. I had to reimagine how to communicate my research about my proposed topic, fast fashion, to my new topic, AI and empathy, across multiple platforms, tailoring tone, structure, and design to meet the expectations of totally different audiences. Planning an Instagram infographic forced me to simplify complex data into punchy visuals, while the op-ed taught me how to balance persuasive writing with credible evidence. The short documentary plan helped me consider how visuals and audio work together to tell a compelling story. It wasn’t just about picking cool formats; it was about learning how genres do rhetorical work in real-life contexts. That do-over honestly made me better at matching content to form and audience—skills that are central to producing research across genres.
